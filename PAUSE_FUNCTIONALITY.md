# 🛑 Stream Pause/Stop Functionality

## **🚀 New Feature: Interactive Stream Control**

The send button now transforms into a **pause/stop button** during AI streaming, giving users direct control over AI responses.

### **🎯 How It Works**

#### **Normal State (Ready to Send)**
- **Green send button** ✉️ with emerald gradient
- Hover effect with shimmer animation
- Disabled if no input text

#### **Streaming State (AI Responding)**
- **Red stop button** 🛑 with red gradient  
- Square stop icon instead of send arrow
- Tooltip: "Stop AI response"
- Status text: "AI responding... (click stop to pause)"

#### **Search State (Web Search Active)**
- **Red stop button** 🛑 with red gradient
- Square stop icon
- Tooltip: "Stop search"
- Status text: "Searching web... (click stop to cancel)"

### **🔧 Functionality**

1. **During AI Streaming**:
   - Click stop → Pauses the stream
   - Creates resumable stream state
   - Shows toast: "🛑 Stream Stopped - You can resume it later"
   - Stream becomes resumable via inline resume buttons

2. **During Web Search**:
   - Click stop → Cancels the search
   - Shows toast: "🔍 Search Cancelled"
   - Stops the entire operation

3. **Integration with Resumable Streams**:
   - Paused streams automatically become resumable
   - Inline resume buttons appear in interrupted messages
   - Seamless pause → resume workflow

### **🎨 Visual Design**

```
Normal:    [🚀] Send (Green)
Streaming: [⏹️] Stop (Red) 
Searching: [⏹️] Stop (Red)
```

**Design Features:**
- Smooth color transition from green to red
- Animated shimmer effects
- Scale animation on hover
- Clear visual state indicators

### **💡 Benefits**

- ✅ **User Control**: Stop unwanted responses immediately
- ✅ **Resource Saving**: Don't waste tokens on unwanted content  
- ✅ **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback and control
- ✅ **Resumable**: Paused streams can be resumed later
- ✅ **Intuitive**: Standard pause/stop UI pattern

### **🧪 Test Scenarios**

1. **Basic Pause**: Send message → Click stop during streaming → Verify pause
2. **Resume After Pause**: Pause stream → Find inline resume button → Resume
3. **Search Cancel**: Enable web search → Send message → Stop during search
4. **Multiple Pauses**: Pause multiple streams → Resume individually

The pause functionality provides users with much better control over their AI interactions! 🎉
